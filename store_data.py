The valleys are surrounded by the Hindu Kush mountain range. Kalasha Valley is located at an elevation of over 6,500 feet above sea level, and is characterized by steep slopes, narrow gorges, and rocky terrain. The area is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including rare species such as the snow leopard and the Himalayan black bear.

        {"name": "Shandur Pass", "description": " Shandur Pass(Urdu: شندور) is a pass located on the boundary of district Chitral, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan and Gilgit-Baltistan, a disputed territory within the larger region of Kashmir. Historically part of Gilgit-Baltistan; however, recent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments have made claims for the Shandur. Known as the Roof of the World, famous for polo matches. The pass hosts the annual Shandur Polo Festival, an event that features polo matches between teams representing the Chitral District and Gilgit-Baltistan (disputed territory within the larger Kashmir region). These matches are held at the Shandur Polo Ground, located on Shandur Top. The festival typically spans three days, taking place from July 7 to July 9 each year. Approximately seven polo matches are played during this festival. Shandur Pass, which is considered one of the most serene areas of Pakistan, is at an elevation of around 12,500 feet. It connects these two regions of Pakistan via a road. It is 212 km away from Gilgit."},
        {"name": "Tirich Mir", "description": "Terich Mir (also spelled Terichmir, Tirich Mir and Turch Mir) is the highest mountain of the Hindu Kush range, and the highest mountain in the world outside of the Himalayas–Karakoram range, at 7,708 meters (25,289 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It’s the 33rd highest peak in the world. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was on 21 July 1950 by a Norwegian-British expedition consisting of Arne Næss, P. Kvernberg, H. Berg, and Tony Streather,[2] depicted in the documentary film Tirich Mir til topps. Tirich Mir overlooks the town of Chitral, and can be easily seen from the main bazaar.It’s the 33rd highest peak in the world. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was on 21 July 1950 by a Norwegian-British expedition consisting of Arne Næss, P. Kvernberg, H. Berg, and Tony Streather,[2] depicted in the documentary film Tirich Mir til topps. Tirich Mir overlooks the town of Chitral, and can be easily seen from the main bazaar. It is the highest mountain in the province of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa. In fact, it is the highest mountain of Pakistan outside the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The last village situated in Chitral District before the mountain begins is the village of Tirich.[citation needed] This valley begins at Soorwaht, where Tirich River meets Torkhow River from the west, up to Shagrom—the last permanent settlement of the valley. From that point onwards, there are summertime grazing pastures and shepherd huts leading up to the snout of the lower Tirich glacier, which goes further up to Tirich Concordia, where glaciers from seven sub-valleys slide down and join at the Concordia glacial confluence. It is believed the origin of the name Tirich Mir is King of Tirich as Tirich is the name of a side valley of the Mulkhow valley of Chitral which leads up to Tirich Mir. An alternative etymology derives this name from the Wakhi language. In Wakhi, trich means shadow or darkness and mir means king, so Tirich Mir means king of darkness. It could have gotten this name as it creates long shadows on the Wakhan side of its face. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Tirich Mir’s first ascent and encourage visitors to the region, the Pakistani authorities have announced free permits in 2024-5 for both climbing and trekking Tirich Mir. The weather station 4,245 m (13,927 ft) above sea level lies in the Tundra climate/Alpine climate (ET) zone according to Köppen Climate Classification. On this specific altitude (4,245 m or 13,927 ft asl) we find moderately cold winters and cool summers generally above freezing. Annual mean temperature is −5.25 °C (22.55 °F), which puts the station well inside the range of continuous permafrost. The average temperature in the coldest month of January is −17.5 °C (0.5 °F) and the two hottest months of July and August have mean temperatures of 6.5 °C (43.7 °F). Average low temperatures range from −23 °C (−9 °F) in January to 0 °C (32 °F) in July and August. The summit has an Ice cap climate (EF) where no month has an average temperature above 0 °C (32 °F).

        {"name": "Chitral Fort", "description": "The Chitral Fort is a fortification in Chitral town, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.[1] The fort is situated on the banks of the Chitral River. Chitral Fort, City of Chitral was constructed by Maharaja of Parmar Rajputs, before the 3rd century, which occupied the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. In the 3rd century AD, Kanishka, the ruler of the Kushan Empire, occupied Chitral. In the 4th century AD, the Chinese overran the valley. Raees rule over Chitral began in 1320 and came to an end in the 15th century. From 1571 onwards Chitral was the capital of the princely state of Chitral under the rule of the Katur Dynasty. The fort has a commanding position on the river and is believed to have been built in 1774 during the reign of Mohtaram Shah Katur II and restored in 1911 by His Highness Sir Shuja ul-Mulk.[3] The compound used to house the barracks of the guards of Mehtar of Chitral. The fort was declared as the personal property of the last ruler of Chitral following the merger of Chitral State in 1969. It is now occupied by the current ceremonial Mehtar, Fateh-ul-Mulk Ali Nasir who has renovated the old Darbar Hall and state rooms following damage sustained during the earthquake of 2015. The Chitral Expedition was a military expedition in 1895 sent by the British authorities to relieve the fort which was under siege after a local coup. After the death of the old ruler, power changed hands several times. An intervening British force of about 400 men was besieged in the fort until it was relieved by two expeditions, a small one from Gilgit and a larger one from Peshawar. A historical fort from the Chitral royal family."},

Dorāh Pass (14,940 feet [4,554 metres) connects this part of Pakistan with Badakhshan, the adjacent province of Afghanistan.The spring water emerges from underground sulfur deposits making its temperature rise above boiling point. For the same reason, the spring is also known as Sulphur Spring.[3] The spring is the warmest in the westward extension of the Himalayan Geothermal Belt. It emerges from leucogranites of the Hindu Kush Range that date from 20–18 Ma. Reservoir temperatures may be as high as 260 °C (500 °F). It is not clear whether the circulation of deep groundwater in this region is driven by topography or by tectonic lateral stress. The Khowar is the official language spoken in this valley. The population of Garam Chashma is approximately 50,000 people. Since the last census in Pakistan was conducted in 1998, there is no precise source of information in this regard.

The tunnel effectively bypassed Pakistan's reliance on Afghanistan to reach Chitral region. It is operated by the National Highway Authority and carries traffic on the N-45 National Highway, thus bypassing Lowari Pass. Construction was partly completed by June 2017. By late 2018, the tunnel was open to vehicular traffic for at least ten hours per day.The total cost of the tunnel was Rs. 26.954 billion (US$93 million).[8] The tunnel is one of the longest tunnels in South Asia, and is the longest in Pakistan, superseding the 3.91 km (2.43 mi) Khojak Tunnel in 2018. The tunnel essentially allows traffic on the N45 National Highway to bypass the Lowari Pass and reduces the 14 hour drive between Chitral and Peshawar to only 7 hours. The tunnel also facilitates all-weather transportation, as during the long winter season the Lowari Pass is closed, and travelers to and from Chitral used to travel into Kunar, Afghanistan and then back into Pakistan to access the rest of the country. Lower tunnel has effectively bypassed Pakistan's reliance on Afghanistan to access Chitral region. The tunnel is facilitating economic development in the Chitral district, as of late 2018"},

The polo tournament is played between the teams of Gilgit District and Chitral District, under freestyle rules. Organized and financed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government, the tournament is held at Shandur Top which is the world highest polo ground at an altitude of 3,700 meters (the pass itself is at 3,800 meters). The festival also includes folk music, dancing and a camping village is set up.[3] The polo tournament is featured in the first episode of Himalaya with Michael Palin. Polo is an equestrian sport first played in Central Asia in 6th century BC. Its objective was to train the cavalry and simulate a real-life battle. The world’s highest polo ground is in the small village of Shindoor in Pakistan. Located at an altitude of 12,000 feet above sea level, the ground sits in the shadow of the towering Hindukash mountain range. In 1935, UK Administrator for Northern Areas Evelyn Hey Cobb asked Balti Raja of Skardu, Ali Sher Khan Anchan, and Nambardar of Chitral, Niat Qabool Hayat Kakakhel, to construct a polo ground in Shandur, which was duly completed with the help of the local population. This polo ground was later on named as Mas Junali. The word Mass Junali is derived from Khowar language. The word Mas means moon and Junali means polo ground. Cobb was impressed by Kakakhail's resourcefulness and efficiency and wished to reward him for his service, but Kakakhail refused to accept any reward for his work. Instead, for the common benefit, Kakakhail asked Cobb to bring trout to stock the local streams. Cobb ordered live trout from England and dropped them into the Ghizer River. Due to this service, the Directorate of Fisheries was established and hundreds of people were employed. Now, the mass of those fishes in Hundarap Lake reaches 24 kg and in Baha Lake Khukush Nallah, their mass reaches 40 kg.[4][5][6][7][8][9] Therefore, Mas Junali became a source of connection between the people of Chitral District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan.A world-famous polo tournament played at 12,000 feet."},

However, after the status of Chitral as an autonomous princedom came to an end in 1969, the festivals of the indigenous mountain communities ceased to be celebrated until 2003 when Jashan-e- Chitral for the first time was revived through the support of UNESCO after its discontinuation for 27 years and Jashan-e- Qaqlasht after abandoning for 35 years. In recent years, Qaqlasht festival is celebrated in the month of April. Major Events of the festival includes traditional sports like Polo, and Matches of tug of war, Falcon prey, Race, Shooting(of ‘Siyah Kaman’), Local hockey, football and other activities like Buddy Dik, Cultural show, Quiz competition, Mushaira, Traditional food stalls, and paragliding."}
